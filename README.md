  age: number;
  brainCells?: number;
}

I'm 15 years old (full stack?) developer. My (prolly) greatest achievement is creating cheats for many e-learning platforms, packed into one service called [Cheat Network](https://cheatnetwork.eu).

I'm into coding since I was about 13 years old. During this time, I became fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript, became familiar with Python, and tried Go, Java and C++.

Road to **full stack** from **fool stack**.
