Hi, I'm Piotr - 15 years old software developer and 1st grade high school student from Poland.
Better known as pxtrez - developer of a cheat platform for many e-learning platforms called [Cheat Network](https://cheatnetwork.eu).

I'm into coding since I was about 13 years old. During this time, I became fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript, became familiar with Python, and tried Go and C++.
I love bypassing security and finding ways to cheat the system. Admiring the devs of game cheats (ur sickkk).

Road to **full stack** from **fool stack**.
